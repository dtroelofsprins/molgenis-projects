eucan:studyID:3D 	3D Study - Design, Develop, Discover	3D	"The main objective of the 3D study is to create a large pregnancy and birth cohort, allowing for the assessment of the effects of combined prenatal exposure on both birth outcomes and longer-term infant and child health. The specific objectives are to:

1) Determine the effects of pre- and post-natal exposures to environmental contaminants, nutritional factors and psychosocial stress on pregnancy and neurodevelopmental outcomes;
2) Assess the contribution of social, genetic, epigenetic, nutritional and environmental factors to the etiology and outcomes of IUGR and preterm birth; and
3) Assess the effects of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) on indicators of epigenetic modifications, and the relationship between such epigenetic changes and infant neurodevelopmental, cardiovascular, and metabolic outcomes."	2010		https://www.irnpqeo.ca/en/														eucan:3D:mothers,eucan:3D:partners,eucan:3D:children				
eucan:studyID:APrON	Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition	APrON	"The objectives of APrON are to: 

- Examine the associations between maternal prenatal nutritional intake and status and mothers' and children's mental health and children's neurodevelopment;
- Investigate the risk factors associated with maternal and paternal perinatal mood, and the impact of maternal and paternal perinatal mood on pregnancy and birth outcomes, as well as children's mental health and neurodevelopment;
- Establish a DNA biobank that could be used to examine the influence of genomics on children's mental health and neurodevelopment."	2009		http://www.apronstudy.ca/														eucan:APrON:mothers,eucan:APrON:partners,eucan:APrON:children				
eucan:studyID:AOBF	All Our Babies and All Our Families	AOB/F	The All Our Babies and All Our Families (AOB/F) study is a prospective community-based pregnancy cohort that follows maternal-infant pairs across the early life course to describes the mental health and psychosocial characteristics of mothers living in Calgary and area, as well as estimating rates of low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births. This study is intended to help understand women's prenatal care experiences in Calgary and identify barriers and facilitators to accessing care.	2008		http://allourfamiliesstudy.com/														eucan:AOBF:mothers,eucan:AOBF:children				
eucan:studyID:START	South Asian Birth Cohort	START	"The START study aims to understand the environmental and genetic determinants of adiposity and related metabolic abnormalities among South Asians living in India and Canada.The main objectives of the START study are: 

- to characterize the in-utero environment by assessing the influence of antenatal maternal, paternal factors (e.g. medical history, dietary intake, smoking exposure, and psychosocial stress), and pregnancy factors (e.g. abnormal gestational glucose tolerance, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm births, and newborn small and large-for-gestational age birth weight) across diverse environments on newborn's body composition, birth weight and length;
- to study the association between early feeding practices (i.e. breastfeeding, weaning and complimentary feeding pattern) and post-natal growth and adiposity at 1 and 3 years after birth across diverse environments; and
- to study the association between specific micronutrient (vitamin B12, homocysteine and folate) status and gestational weight gain with body composition and birth weight across diverse environments."	2011		http://www.southasianbirthcohort.com/Home														eucan:START:mothersCA,eucan:START:mothersUI,eucan:START:mothersRI,eucan:START:childrenCA,eucan:START:childrenUI,eucan:START:childrenRI
